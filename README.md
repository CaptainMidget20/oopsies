# Shader Collection
A bunch of shaders i made since i first started learning. I obviously only picked out the ones i like. This is for the purpose of sharing with friends and to better organize my work. Please give credit where it is due, and do not share this unless I have given you permission. I hope you enjoy and I can't wait to see your creations.
